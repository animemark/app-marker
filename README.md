The marking/discuss system for bato.to sites

Base on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Used [react-app-rewire-multiple-entry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewire-multiple-entry) to enable multiple page entry

Many apis have not yet been developed. If you need an api, you can send me the detailed requirements on discord, and we will do our best to develop it.

We use VS Code as the code editor.

Use the [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) plug-in to compile scss files into css files in real time.

This is the first time we use react as a development framework, so for the issue of react itself, you'd better refer to the official documentation of react.

The current code of this project is not complicated. If you can't understand it, please learn the relevant knowledge by yourself first.
